# RAGProject
A simple chatbot using RAG - chat about any document you use to train it.

This project uses a Gemini API Key and a custom compare embeddings function in order to train a chatbot on 3 markdown files. 
On successful execution, the user can chat with the bot about the markdown files in the data folder. It also lists the sources from where it got the information.

Here is an example of it working:
