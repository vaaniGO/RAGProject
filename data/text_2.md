“Nietzsche defines nihilism as the situation which obtains when "everything is permitted." If everything is permitted, then it makes no difference what we do, and so nothing is worth anything. We can, of course, attribute value by an act of arbitrary resolution, but such an act proceeds ex nihilo [out of nothing] or defines its significance by a spontaneous assertion which can be negated with equal justification. More specifically, there is in such a case no justification for choosing either the value originally posited or its negation, and the speech of "justification" is indistinguishable from silence. For those who are not gods, recourse to a creation ex nihilo… reduces reason to nonsense by equating the sense or significance of speech with silence.”

In this essay, I will be dealing with the Preface to Stanley Rosen’s *Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay*. Specifically, I will explore the fundamental existence underlying all humanity, including that of ‘silence’. Here, ‘silence’ refers to the concept as described by Rosen – a condition where no particular justification is valuable over the other, so all justification loses meaning, leading to a state where speech is futile. Further, Rosen argues that the implementation of the Original Language Philosophy leads to a negation of its very own principles–this is what results in silence, hence becoming a version of nihilism.

Reason is not something that we can impose on an indifferent universe. Rather, it is something that brings us closer to discovering the very nature of the universe. However, we can’t proceed about the nature of ‘reason’ without having some presupposition about the nature of the very universe it aims to describe? This would mean that even the Original Language Philosophy stems out of some preliminary understanding. However, here, nihilism is attacking what stems out of presupposition and declaring that to be null and void. Shouldn’t nihilism attack the presupposition rather than its manifestation, as we are essentially saying that it is the presupposition which gives us the most elementary form of meaning? In other words, what if nihilism, as we understand it, pointed to an absence of this elementary belief rather than an absence of robust justification? I will also explore that this absence of elementary belief is not likely – this makes bleak even the possibility of true nihilism to exist.

This serves not only to add onto Rosen’s argument for the incoherence of nihilistic arguments, but also go a step further in saying that even if the arguments are incoherent, nihilism likely cannot coexist with human nature.

In our current world, speech does exist. So what exactly is it that Rosen is afraid will lead to silence? Rosen attributes this imminent issue to the separation of ‘good’ from ‘reason’ and the rise of subjectivity over objectivity. Moreover, he alludes to self-contradictory models (specifically, the Original Language Philosophy), which on being implemented, result in meaninglessness. At this, one may argue that even to assert meaningfulness or meaninglessness, there is some intrinsic presence that we all take as a presupposition. The fact that we have come up with flawed concepts is an advocate that even the road to silence entails comprehension of ‘meaning’. This being the case, even if humanity does reach a dead-end silence situation, won’t our innate intuition of meaning make us aware of it, or create some disequilibrium? Rosen says that Nihilism is an unending threat, and this threat can only be dissolved if human nature is dissolved. However, in this case described above, nihilism may never be able to fulfill its presupposed conclusion as long as human nature exists, and can only fulfill its conditions if human nature is dissolved.

Now, Rosen says that silence is “rendered articulate” by speech. In other words, he is arguing that speech in the absence of some underlying objective standard cannot be treated as a source of meaning (because it is tantamount to his concept of silence). In this, I agree with Rosen by saying that human nature is the paramount source of meaning; human nature is something unperturbed by silence or speech. Here, I will elaborate on the characteristics of the theory of fundamental human existence which would support my argument most strongly. I will operate with the concept of Being that is timeless[^1] and objective. It may be elusive but it is such that existence cannot be a concept without it.

In his work, *Must We Mean What We Say?*, Stanley Cavell, an American Philosopher who worked deeply in the field of Original Language Philosophy, says that language does not build on language, language builds on the world. If pragmatic implications (Here I acknowledge the ambiguity of the meaning of ‘pragmatism’ in itself. There is further scope for investigation here. However, I posit that for something to be pragmatic it means that it holds some meaning that we can experience.) cannot be constructed in terms of inductive and deductive reasoning then should we acknowledge the presence of some third kind of logic? Moreover, P.F. Strawson, of Oxford, says that “We might think of formal logic not as a guarantor of understanding, but only as a substitute for it.” These serve to illustrate my arguments well because they also bring out the underlying fundamental existence beneath all language.

As illustrated above, in the scope of Rosen’s robust argument to establish the incoherence of theories, there is scope to investigate even beyond theories, and prove how even at a very fundamental level of existence, nihilism is inconceivable. We humans deliberate a world devoid of human nature. How can we do that without embodying our very own human nature?

### **NOTES**

1. In Advaita Vedanta, reality is seen as a non-dual Brahman, which is timeless and changeless.

2. Aquinas, in a Thomistic framework, posited that Being itself (esse) is an objective, foundational principle of all existence which is necessary and absolute, making existence a manifestation of an objective, divine reality.
