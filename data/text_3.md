# **Guidelines for Trainers**

1. **Maintain your authenticity:**  
   Stay true to your unique personality while tailoring your style based on each client. Use judgment on how best to adjust your approach according to individual needs.

2. **Punctuality is key:**  
   - Start on time and end on time.  
   - Aim to log in to your session 5 minutes early to adjust your camera, Bluetooth device, and room setup.  
   - Trainers will wait for the client up to 15 minutes after the scheduled session start time.  
   - If the client does not join within 5-10 minutes, send a message in the WhatsApp group.  
   - If the admin does not respond or the client has not joined for 15 minutes, the trainer may log off, and the session will be marked as complete.

3. **Prepare for your first session:**  
   - Pre-read the customer profile.  
   - Balance the first session by getting to know the customer, understanding their goals, and incorporating the actual yoga practice.

4. **Start with mindfulness, not religion:**  
   - While chanting or religious mantras are common in India, clients may feel uncomfortable with religious elements.  
   - It’s fine to use Omkara for grounding, but avoid mantras unless explicitly asked.  
   - You can ask, "I generally start with a short mantra for peace and grounding. It’s completely optional; would you like to experience that?"  
   - Adjust based on the response.

5. **Explain the ‘why’ behind the practice:**  
   - Briefly explain the reasoning behind each step of the practice, whether it's the breathing pattern, the asanas/postures, or other elements.

6. **Engage with the clients:**  
   - Building a relationship is key. Encourage and motivate clients by recognizing their progress and helping them work toward their goals.  
   - Engage actively with clients to foster motivation and a positive experience.

7. **Therapy component:**  
   - There is significant value in the therapeutic aspect of yoga. However, be cautious about overcommitting.  
   - We NEVER replace doctors, medication, or any other medical treatments.  
   - We help manage and teach self-practice techniques to minimize health issues or discomforts, which “could” complement ongoing medical treatment.

8. **Communication with clients:**  
   - All communication with clients must be conducted through the dashboard messaging center.  
   - Communication with the admin team, urgencies, and emergencies may be handled through the WhatsApp group, but routine communication with the FK admin team should occur on the dashboard messaging center.

9. **Confidentiality:**  
   - NEVER share personal details, contact numbers, or any sensitive information with clients.

10. **Check your emails regularly:**  
    - Always check your emails at least once every 4 hours during the day, before bedtime, and in the morning upon waking up.  
    - Important notifications, such as new sessions or reschedules, will be communicated via email.  
    - Be mindful of time differences between the USA and India, as session updates might come outside of your regular working hours.
