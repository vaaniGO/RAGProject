### **Nietzsche and Science-fiction**

This paper explores Nietzsche's stance on the concept of truth, illustrates its detrimental repercussions for hard science specifically, and finally states how and why science can still be approached unless nihilism is acceptable. This is done through an exploration of physics and computer networks to assert the superiority of scientific methods of observation over scientific "truth" and to probe a reevaluation of the concept of "validity," while allowing scope for Nietzsche’s argument to hold.

To understand Nietzsche's stance on truth, it is essential to first examine his critique of human intellect, which he sees as a self-serving product of pride and egocentricity rather than a reliable tool for uncovering objective reality. He argues that humans operate under the misconception that their worldview is the definitive framework for interpreting the world. However, it is just one among many equally valid frameworks. For instance, a deep-sea creature might believe that the dominant state of matter in the world is liquid. Intellect, as a mark of self-importance, ironically works against its purpose by obscuring perception and inflating the importance of mankind’s temporal existence. As noted in his essay, attributing significance to things is an “arbitrary” act that seeks to reconcile its own creation. The result of this is a collection of anthropomorphic truths that are ultimately either circular or of limited meaning.

Appropriately then, Nietzsche calls truth a “mobile army of metaphors” – a progressive sedimentation of symbolic ideas where the primary layers are nerve stimuli, sounds, and images, followed by metaphors, all encrypted into our cognitive framework. For instance, perceiving a bird starts off by a nerve stimulus, which connects with our cognitive schema labeled as ‘bird,’ which is a metaphor for what a bird objectively is. As humanity evolves, these metaphors solidify and come to be known as universal. This would mean that all of language, and therefore understanding, are direct results of years of conditioning. Etymology offers clear examples of the transitory nature of language, which inevitably is pivotal when talking about ‘truth.’ This is seen when, over time, words change in their ‘meaning.’ For instance, the word ‘silly’ shifted from meaning something positive (blessed) to, now, something pejorative (foolish). One might ask, what remains of objective meaning if our tools of conveying meaning can point to different things depending on the time and speaker?

Another shortcoming of this system of truth is that words often point to a non-exhaustive list of traits of the object that they refer to; often, these are cardinal traits. The problem that arises is that these traits are non-exclusive. For example, in the Cambridge Dictionary’s definition of the word ‘cat,’ the first part of the definition could describe a dog or any other furry, four-legged animal, while the second part is a reflection of cultural associations, rather than a cat in itself.

Drawing from his arguments on the elusivity of absolute truth, Nietzsche says that the laws of nature can only be known as relational constructs. This means truth can only hold in the protected context of its framework. One might ask whether the absence of 'absolute' value leads to a nihilistic outlook – if there exists no attainable system for choosing one justification over the other, then all speech reduces to silence. In the context of hard science, Nietzsche’s argument serves to question its very foundation by weakening its ‘laws’ and reducing it to fiction.

This can be seen in several instances. Nietzsche posits that what humans today perceive as the “mathematical beauty of nature” is a trick of perception, not reality. He might argue that humans’ recognition of the Fibonacci spiral in nature (something known for its mathematical elegance) is a direct result of their invention of the mathematical school of thought and its application to their observations of the natural world. Likewise, universal constants (which have been indispensable to essentially all scientific progress and explanations, like pi) are trivialized under the assumption that they are not intrinsic, but rather an outcome of relational constructs, where truths are, by construction, bound to hold.

This is illustrated in the scientific discipline of Physics. In his theory of scientific revolution, Thomas Kuhn talks about the process of observation, hypotheses, tests, and pivots that lead to paradigm shifts and radical progress – for example, the journey from looking at the moon to sending a person to the moon. From a Nietzschean perspective, this paradigm shift only drives ‘progress’ in terms of results within a construct, for it does not find the absolute truth. One can suggest that physicists work on relational constructs linked to observation and mathematical precision as a direct result of bridging gaps that were perhaps created on the basis of the initial premises. This takes away the apparent ‘beauty’ of scientific truth; however, the beauty of the scientific method of observation might remain.

Nietzsche points out that many things (here, in the field of physics) are happening, whether we observe them or not, independent of the explanations we attribute to them. Consequently, I propose that we see science not as a dictator of the absolute truth, but as a rigorous form of practicing observation. The plethora of unanswered questions, paradoxes, and mysteries in physics show that it does not claim to have found a universal truth; it could all well be a way of accessing truth at our current stage of understanding. Even if Nietzsche were to deny the permanence of the truths of physics, there is little ground to deny the observation that physics leads us to (else all discussion flattens to the question of what reality is), and the meaning inherent to the scientific method of observation isolated from the end results.

Turning to the field of computing, something that humanity has made from scratch, one can understand the validity of truth within a framework. The journey from hand-typing binary digits to program a system, to neural networks that can process trillions of calculations in less than a second, has been achieved by a system where logic piles up on logic – a good example of Nietzsche’s metaphorical scaffolding – which he would say leads to limited validity. Countering this, I suggest that we understand ‘validity’ differently. This points to a pragmatist approach which states that "truth" is what works in practice. One can think of truth as a practice rather than a result. Truth could refer to the starting point of thought, not the end. It is important to have such starting points because otherwise, to see through everything is to see nothing at all (if we can assign concreteness to nothing, then everything is void). For example, a potential starting point for accessing truth can be belief in the validity of language. This will enable us to use language to get at something. In the absence of such a system of belief, nihilism becomes imminent.

This approach invites a broader reevaluation of all study and intellectual frameworks. It encourages rigorous observation and adaptability while preserving meaning, utility, and progress in a world where ultimate certainty is unattainable either way.

### **NOTES**

1. This idea can be connected with G.E. Moore’s concept of a naturalistic fallacy, that ‘value-terms’ (like “good,” “bad”) are used by intuition rather than definition, because it is impossible to define these words in a way that does not rely on words that also reflect the same value (making it circular).

2. The Cambridge Dictionary defines “cat” as: “A small animal with fur, four legs, a tail, and claws, usually kept as a pet or for catching mice.”

First part: a small animal with fur, four legs, a tail, and claws,

Second part: usually kept as a pet or for catching mice.
